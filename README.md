# Beyond the Gini
## Introduction

The “**American Dream**” is built on the promise of social mobility—the idea that if you work hard and get an education, you can succeed regardless of your background. Education is touted as the "Great Equalizer.”

However, economic data suggests a different reality. The United States has one of the highest levels of income inequality among developed nations (Gini Coefficient > 40).

This gives rise to questions : 

1. Does this high level of income inequality create a barrier to education? And if so, where is that barrier located? 
2. Does it stop poor children from entering school, or does it stop them from graduating from college?

This project explores whether wealth inequality acts as a “floor” (preventing access) or a “ceiling” (limiting upward mobility) in the US education system.

## Objective

To statistically quantify the relationship between income inequality (measured by the Gini Index) and educational inequality (measured by the completion gap between the richest and poorest quintiles).

The project’s primary aims are: 

- To visualize the trend of income inequality in the USA over the last decade.
- To calculate the “Opportunity Gap”—the difference in completion rates between the Top 20% and Bottom 20% of households.
- To determine if this gap is uniform across all levels of education (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary).
- To analyze if years with higher income inequality correlate with wider educational gaps.

### **Recommendations**

Based on the data, policy interventions should not focus on *building schools* (access is already there), but on **bridging the gap at the higher level**:

1. **Targeted Financial Aid:** Increase Pell Grants specifically for the bottom income quintile to lower the “price of admission” to the middle class.
2. **Retention Support:** Funding should be directed toward mentorship and emergency assistance to ensure low-income students who enter college actually graduate.
3. **Non-Degree Pathways:** Strengthen vocational training to provide economic mobility that doesn’t require a 4-year degree.

### **Conclusion**

The data proves that in the United States, **Income Inequality acts as a barrier to advancement, not entry.**
While the “Floor” of K-12 education is solid, the “Ceiling” of higher education remains locked by wealth. Until the tertiary gap is addressed, education cannot truly serve as the “Great Equalizer.”
